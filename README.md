## My process

Step 1: Analyze design picture and think of a plan about what structure to use with HTML and CSS. I ended up with wrapping blocks of content into block level elements like sections, header or footers. Semantic HTML was my goal here. With CSS i ended up using flexbox.

Step 2: Build HTML and wrap the elements in need of a container to their own containers for easier layouting with flexbox. 

Step 3: Once HTML is done and appropriate classes have been added for elements in need. Start styling with CSS using flexbox.

Step 4: Start from top to bottom styling one section at a time.

Step 5: Once all section complete, start focusing on details, such as font sizes, colors and list markers.

Step 6: 
That's all, page build Complete!


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox



### What I learned

I learned to use Semantic HTML in this project. I didn't have much experience with Semantic HTML markup but i decided to push myself to use as much as possible of semantic HTML in this project and i am happy that i did.



### Continued development

On my next projects, i want to start focusing more on aria attributes for accessibility.
